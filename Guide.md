### Introduction

**Why verification is important**

Abdulaziz Aletibi (@abdulaziz_Photo) posted a picture on Instagram of a child sleeping between his parent's grave as a depiction of a Syrian child who just lost his family. It went viral on social media with people discussing it, along with politicians, and even some news agencies used it to write breaking news stories.

At that moment no one had thought of the person who took the photo. No-one asked questions such as Where was the photo taken? Which date, and for which reason? What is the story behind it?

When  Abdulaziz saw that the image was used in a wrong context, he released another photo to show that this was actually an art project! It wasn't in a grave yard, and the child was his nephew.

A similar incident happened, where a child has been shown in a video being shot by the Syrian regime. It was watched over eight million timeson YouTube.The video was published on BBC trending along with an article where they swrote that the video  was most probably not a fake.

Few days later, a Norwegian film director stated that he was the one who staged the video showing a “Syrian hero boy” under gunfire. It was shot in Malta in May 2014, not Syria. The video was picked by news agencies and social media activists to spread information about the suffering of children in war. Unfortunately this had a negativepolitical impact overall, as by releasing this fake video, and spreading it on social media it made it easier for war criminals to dismiss credible images of abuse by saying most videos online are fake.

In both incidents above, it was difficult to find the original uploader of the content, the source.
It becomes harder when content is downloaded from social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter and uploaded on the same platform with different users accounts, channels etc, or  uploaded on different platforms.  

For example: News aggregators such as ShaamNetwork S.N.N “scrape” content from original uploaders sometimes to their youtube channel which makes it harder to find the source that could have created or shared the content. The photo below shows how they scarped content from a media center in Daraya (Damascus Suburbs) which was showing a helicopter dropping bombs.

The same thing happened when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a playlist of 13 videos that had originally appeared on YouTube, which they had used to look for evidence related to the 2013 chemical weapons attack on Damascus Suburbs in Syria. 

A number of these videos were taken from a well-known Syrian media aggregator,ShaamNetwork S.N.N,YouTube channel which regularly republishes videos from other people’s channels.  Using a range of different verification techniques, Félim McMahon from Storyful was able to discover the original versions of these videos. This is a very good example of how verified videos can be used to strengthen the process of investigating an incident. 

**One of the key issues in verification is confirming:**

- Provenance: Is this the original piece of content?
- Source: Who uploaded the content?
- Date: When was this content captured?
- Location: where was this content captured?

In this chapter we will go through the above elements, which are essential in verification, and will help human rights investigators gain skills, knowledge and tools to work together on verifying data.
