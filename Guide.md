### Introduction

**Why verification is important**

Abdulaziz Aletibi (@abdulaziz_Photo) posted a picture on Instagram of a child sleeping between his parent's grave as a depiction of a Syrian child who just lost his family. It went viral on social media with people discussing it, along with politicians, and even some news agencies used it to write breaking news stories.

At that moment no one had thought of the person who took the photo. No-one asked questions such as Where was the photo taken? Which date, and for which reason? What is the story behind it? 

When  Abdulaziz saw that the image was used in a wrong context, he released another photo to show that this was actually an art project! It wasn't in a grave yard, and the child was his nephew.
