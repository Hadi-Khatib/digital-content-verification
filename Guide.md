### Introduction

**Why verification is important**

Abdulaziz Aletibi (@abdulaziz_Photo) posted a picture on Instagram of a child sleeping between his parent's grave as a depiction of a Syrian child who just lost his family. It went viral on social media with people discussing it, along with politicians, and even some news agencies used it to write breaking news stories.

At that moment no one had thought of the person who took the photo. No-one asked questions such as Where was the photo taken? Which date, and for which reason? What is the story behind it?

When  Abdulaziz saw that the image was used in a wrong context, he released another photo to show that this was actually an art project! It wasn't in a grave yard, and the child was his nephew.

A similar incident happened, where a child has been shown in a video being shot by the Syrian regime. It was watched over eight million timeson YouTube.The video was published on BBC trending along with an article where they swrote that the video  was most probably not a fake.

Few days later, a Norwegian film director stated that he was the one who staged the video showing a “Syrian hero boy” under gunfire. It was shot in Malta in May 2014, not Syria. The video was picked by news agencies and social media activists to spread information about the suffering of children in war. Unfortunately this had a negativepolitical impact overall, as by releasing this fake video, and spreading it on social media it made it easier for war criminals to dismiss credible images of abuse by saying most videos online are fake.

In both incidents above, it was difficult to find the original uploader of the content, the source.
It becomes harder when content is downloaded from social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter and uploaded on the same platform with different users accounts, channels etc, or  uploaded on different platforms.  

For example: News aggregators such as ShaamNetwork S.N.N “scrape” content from original uploaders sometimes to their youtube channel which makes it harder to find the source that could have created or shared the content. The photo below shows how they scarped content from a media center in Daraya (Damascus Suburbs) which was showing a helicopter dropping bombs.

The same thing happened when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a playlist of 13 videos that had originally appeared on YouTube, which they had used to look for evidence related to the 2013 chemical weapons attack on Damascus Suburbs in Syria. 

A number of these videos were taken from a well-known Syrian media aggregator,ShaamNetwork S.N.N,YouTube channel which regularly republishes videos from other people’s channels.  Using a range of different verification techniques, Félim McMahon from Storyful was able to discover the original versions of these videos. This is a very good example of how verified videos can be used to strengthen the process of investigating an incident. 

**One of the key issues in verification is confirming:**

- Provenance: Is this the original piece of content?
- Source: Who uploaded the content?
- Date: When was this content captured?
- Location: where was this content captured?

In this chapter we will go through the above elements, which are essential in verification, and will help human rights investigators gain skills, knowledge and tools to work together on verifying data. 

**Why we are using Syria as a case study?**

All examples in this chapter are coming from the Syrian context because hundreds of thousands videos and pictures during the conflict have been produced by media activists documenting all sort of atrocities and crimes the Syrian population has been suffering because of the civil war. 

Journalists from Syria, and other countries have been puting lots of efforts to verify this digital content as there has been many incidents of fabricated content. We though that this would be a good context where we can learn from many incidents that have emerged.

**Security concerns**

As you will while going through the chapter, we will be featuring tools and services that can help you out to verify digital content generated online. Most of these tools belong to private companies, and they are closed source. This means that when uploading content to these services, you won't be able to control how these companies use this contect, and to whome they share it with. 
Some of these services don't implement secure connection to the internet which might put you at risk. Also your location will be exposed on these sites if you don't hide it. We will go into details of how you can protect yourself while carrying out an online investigation. 

**Is it possible to verify digital content generated online just by using a tool?**






## Checking Provenance

It is essential that human rights investigators confirm the authenticity of any information or content they get through the internet via social media websites or other platforms as it can be easily fabricated. For example it is very easy to fake a tweet through the  website below, which can then be shared as a picture. 
URL: letmetweetthatforyou.com

The image above can then be shared on twitter which will make it appear as original tweet.

Fakers can also retweet fake information such as: (Good news! RT@PresidentSY I'm announcing my retirement from politics).

They can also add a blue verification check mark to the cover photo of the faked accounts. 

Here are few steps to check the authenticity of the content:

[1] Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have a way of verifying personal profiles or pages through blue tick which is normally added to personal profiles or social media pages. Hover over the blue tick, and you will see the text “verified account” pop up. If it’s not there, then it is not a verified account.

Twitter verified account looks like:

Facebook verified account:

Youtube verified account:

But we can't depend on these official verification programmes as it's not available for all users, as a result we end up most of the time checking profiles or pages that do not include any blue tick on it. 

[2]  Check out details available on the profile to confirm that it's original and not fake.

**Things to think about:**

A. Are there any linked websites to this profile?
B. Check out the previous pictures and videos.
C. If they share content, where do they post about/from usually?
D. Check out previous pictures, and videos.
E. How many followers, friends, or subscribers they have?
F. Who are they following?

Example:

Lets say someone shared a YouTube video on a specific platform about a human rights violation incident. First thing you need to do is to go the YouTube profile of this user. In this case below, you will see that his name is Yasser Al-Doumani. He has been uploading daily videos about human rights violations in Syria which are all located in Damascus Suburbs. We understand from this  that he is a Syrian journalist, most probably based in Damascus Suburbs.

Check out about page on his YouTube profile. You will see other websites linked to him. In this case you will see that he has 590 subscribers. He joined in 1 January 2014. His profile has 281,169 views.
Also you can see two linked URLs to the Facebook pages of a coordination group in Damascus Suburbs which usually do media work. The description says that this YouTube channel is dedicated to Douma Coordination group. All this information provides more clarity as to whetherthis account is fake or not. In this case, the account is authentic.

[3] If you are looking into visual evidence such as photo or video, you need to investigate whether this is the original content, how it is used and if modified copies exist. 

**Images**

For images using reverse image search tools such as TinEye or Google Images, is useful to find out if the image you are looking at has been posted online previously.

**Important note: Make sure that you read our saftey guide on how to carry on online investigation securely before using this tool.**
