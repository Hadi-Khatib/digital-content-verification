##  Introduction

**Why verification is important?**

Abdulaziz Aletibi (@abdulaziz_Photo) posted a picture on Instagram of a child sleeping between his parent's grave as a depiction of a Syrian child who just lost his family. It went viral on social media with people discussing it, along with politicians, and even some news agencies used it to write breaking news stories.

photo

At that moment no one had thought of the person who took the photo. No-one asked questions such as Where was the photo taken? Which date, and for which reason? What is the story behind it? 

photo

When  Abdulaziz saw that the image was used in a wrong context, he released another photo to show that this was actually an art project! It wasn't in a grave yard, and the child was his nephew.

A similar incident happened, where a child has been shown in a video being shot by the Syrian regime. It was watched over eight million timeson YouTube.The video was published on BBC trending along with an article where they swrote that the video  was most probably not a fake.

Few days later, a Norwegian film director stated that he was the one who staged the video showing a “Syrian hero boy” under gunfire. It was shot in Malta in May 2014, not Syria. The video was picked by news agencies and social media activists to spread information about the suffering of children in war. Unfortunately this had a negativepolitical impact overall, as by releasing this fake video, and spreading it on social media it made it easier for war criminals to dismiss credible images of abuse by saying most videos online are fake.

In both incidents above, it was difficult to find the original uploader of the content, the source.
It becomes harder when content is downloaded from social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter and uploaded on the same platform with different users accounts, channels etc, or  uploaded on different platforms.  

For example: News aggregators such as ShaamNetwork S.N.N “scrape” content from original uploaders sometimes to their youtube channel which makes it harder to find the source that could have created or shared the content. The photo below shows how they scarped content from a media center in Daraya (Damascus Suburbs) which was showing a helicopter dropping bombs.

photo

The same thing happened when the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee released a playlist of 13 videos that had originally appeared on YouTube, which they had used to look for evidence related to the 2013 chemical weapons attack on Damascus Suburbs in Syria. 

A number of these videos were taken from a well-known Syrian media aggregator,ShaamNetwork S.N.N,YouTube channel which regularly republishes videos from other people’s channels.  Using a range of different verification techniques, Félim McMahon from Storyful was able to discover the original versions of these videos. This is a very good example of how verified videos can be used to strengthen the process of investigating an incident. 

**One of the key issues in verification is confirming:**

- Provenance: Is this the original piece of content?
- Source: Who uploaded the content?
- Date: When was this content captured?
- Location: where was this content captured?

In this chapter we will go through the above elements, which are essential in verification, and will help human rights investigators gain skills, knowledge and tools to work together on verifying data. 

**Why we are using Syria as a case study?**

All examples in this chapter are coming from the Syrian context because hundreds of thousands videos and pictures during the conflict have been produced by media activists documenting all sort of atrocities and crimes the Syrian population has been suffering because of the civil war. 

Journalists from Syria, and other countries have been puting lots of efforts to verify this digital content as there has been many incidents of fabricated content. We though that this would be a good context where we can learn from many incidents that have emerged.

**Security concerns**

As you will see through the chapter, we will be featuring tools and services that can help you out to verify digital content generated online. Most of these tools belong to private companies, and they are closed source. This means that when uploading content to these services, you won't be able to control how these companies will use this it, and to whome they share it with. 
Some of these services don't implement secure connection to the internet which might put you at risk if you are on a public WiFi network. Also your location will be exposed to these sites if you don't hide it. At the end of this chapter we will go into details of how you can protect yourself while carrying out an online investigation. 

**Is it possible to verify digital content generated online just by using one tool?**

You need to use different techniques and tools to be able to verify visual evidence you get online. It's very important to collect as many photos and videos about the incidents as possible. Also it's very helpful to connect with sources from the ground to confirm if an incident has happened, but making sure that you are communnicating with them securely so you don't put them or yourself under a risk specially if you are investigating any sensitive issues. 


We will go through the key elements of digital content verification below with examples that will include techniques, and tools for each one:



## Checking Provenance

It is essential that human rights investigators confirm the authenticity of any information or content they get through the internet via social media websites or other platforms as it can be easily fabricated. For example it is very easy to fake a tweet through the  website below, which can then be shared as a picture. 
URL: letmetweetthatforyou.com

photo

The image above can then be shared on twitter which will make it appear as original tweet.

photo


Fakers can also retweet fake information such as: (Good news! RT@PresidentSY I'm announcing my retirement from politics).

They can also add a blue verification check mark to the cover photo of the faked accounts. 

Here are few steps to check the authenticity of the content:

[1] Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have a way of verifying personal profiles or pages through blue tick which is normally added to personal profiles or social media pages. Hover over the blue tick, and you will see the text “verified account” pop up. If it’s not there, then it is not a verified account.

Twitter verified account looks like:

photo

Facebook verified account:

photo

Youtube verified account:

But we can't depend on these official verification programmes as it's not available for all users, as a result we end up most of the time checking profiles or pages that do not include any blue tick on it. 

[2]  Check out details available on the profile to confirm that it's original and not fake.

**Things to think about:**

A. Are there any linked websites to this profile?
B. Check out the previous pictures and videos.
C. If they share content, where do they post about/from usually?
D. Check out previous pictures, and videos.
E. How many followers, friends, or subscribers they have?
F. Who are they following?

Example:

Lets say someone shared a YouTube video on a specific platform about a human rights violation incident. First thing you need to do is to go the YouTube profile of this user. In this case below, you will see that his name is Yasser Al-Doumani. He has been uploading daily videos about human rights violations in Syria which are all located in Damascus Suburbs. We understand from this  that he is a Syrian journalist, most probably based in Damascus Suburbs.

photo

Check out about page on his YouTube profile. You will see other websites linked to him. In this case you will see that he has 590 subscribers. He joined in 1 January 2014. His profile has 281,169 views.
Also you can see two linked URLs to the Facebook pages of a coordination group in Damascus Suburbs which usually do media work. The description says that this YouTube channel is dedicated to Douma Coordination group. All this information provides more clarity as to whetherthis account is fake or not. In this case, the account is authentic. 

photo

[3] If you are looking into visual evidence such as photo or video, you need to investigate whether this is the original content, how it is used and if modified copies exist. 

## Images

For images using reverse image search tools such as TinEye or Google Images, is useful to find out if the image you are looking at has been posted online previously.

**Important note: Make sure that you read our saftey guide on how to carry on online investigation securely before using this tool.**
[link to the safety chapter]

**Tool:** TinEye

**Website:** https://www.tineye.com/ 

This is an example of how TinEye works:

[1] Go toTinEye's website: https://www.tineye.com/ 

[2] Upload the image you want to search for. We will use the photo taken by the Norwegian film director from the earlier example.

photo

[3] We sort the filter by the “oldest” which will lead us to the people who used this image first, or to the originator of the image. You can also sort by “Biggest Image” because sometimes the first hand originator will be the one uploading high quality version of the image. In this case below, we see that this image was first used by a Norwegian online news website. 

photo - higher quality

There are various free tools that will analyse a photograph’s metadata and compression information, allowing further verification of an images veracity. 
There's also a possibility to verify the dates and location of images if it's included in the metadata of the image. 

Every image has "metadata" attached to it (read more in chapter 6) which includes information about the type of device the image was taken on, camera settings, date and sometimes location information. 

One of the websites that is helpful to pull out metadata is http://fotoforensics.com/ 
**FotoForensics** is a toolbox that provides a suite of photo analysis tools. The public site permits viewing metadata, visualizing the JPEG error level potential, and identifying the last-saved JPEG quality.
FotoForensics does not draw any conclusions. Nothing says "it's photoshopped" or "it's real". The website highlights artifacts that may not be otherwise visible in the picture.

You can upload the image you want to analyse for metadata. This works best if you get a raw photo from the source to be able to analyse it. You won't get the same results when analysing images taken from social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as they strip most metadata when the images are uploaded to their platforms.

**Example:**

You can upload the image on the FotoForensics website, or enter the URL of where the image is stored online image, then click on 'Metadata' where you will see the the information below the image. In this case, the image uploaded was taken from MMC  marramedia center in Syria which is run by activists in that area. The photo shows remains of the weapons used recently In Idlib.

Photo

The results are not always clear, however, and depending on the copy of the file uploaded. 

For example, a JPEG that has been resized, recompressed, and changed from the original file will have much less reliable data than the original full-resolution image recorded by a camera. **However if an image was edited by photoshop by the originator, it doesn't necessarily mean that it was manipulated.** http://www.izitru.com/ is a tool that could help you figuer out of the image is modified or not. 

**Example:**
You can upload an image on Izitru to make sure if it's not manipulated or edited. So this will help you to confirm if this is a raw image or if it has been edited. 

photo -

In this image below, Izitru tells that this is not the original image, and that the image has been edited.

photo

There's a different technique to analyse an image which is called ELA (error-level analysis). It's a forensic method to identify portions of an image with a different level of compression. You can do this through fotoforensics.com as well.

> Photoshoped photo - from Gabi 

There are applications that can be useful to capture the date of the video or photo automatically as well as capturing other important pieces such as GPS data. One such application is CameraV which we introduced in the Metadata chapter of this guide. 

**Camera V:** https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav/ 

## Videos

You can check the original person who uploaded a video on Youtube. If you come across a specific video, and you want to get to the original uploader of this video then you need to use the filter, and sort by upload date as shown below. In this case, we got a video from social media showing alleged chemical attacks in Idlib province, in Syria. By typing the title of the video in the search, and sorting by “Upload date” we get to the account of the original uploader which is “Sarmeen Coordination group”. 
As we mentioned earlier, you need also to check for any linked websites to their channel, number of subscribers, and viewers to make sure that this is not a fake channel.

“Sarmeen Coordination Group” had 2,074 subscribers, over a million views and around 3000 followers on Twitter. They also have been sharing visual evidence from the location for the last four r years. Taken together we can confidentially verify  that the original source, the “Sarmeen Coordination Group”, was the original source of the video. 

Photo

There are no services available for reverse video searches as we saw with Google image reverse orTinEye, so it's not as easy to verify the provenance of the video and it's original source, but there are ways in which you can  carry out a reverse-verification of a video to see if the video has been used and shared in the past or not. This requires you to capture a screenshot of the video at an  important moment to get the best results (the most opportune moment to capture the screenshot is when an incident happens) or you can capture a screenshot of the video thumbnail as it could have been used previously on YouTube or other video hosting services. Then you can run the captured screenshot through TinEye or Google image reverse as we did earlier in this chapter. 

Amnesty International created a tool that will help you implement this technique which you can find here. https://www.amnestyusa.org/citizenevidence/

**Example:**

Enter the YouTube URL that you are interested in, as seen in the example below, then select Go to get Thumbnails which you can then run a reverse image search on.

photo

In this case, this video which has been uploaded by “Abu Shadi AlSafrany” who works in a local media center in a city called Al-Safira. They  haven't been shared online before which means that the videos haven't been used in different countries or contexts. Once you verify that a video is unique, it will be important then to verify the location and the date of the incident to make sure that the video is not fabricated. Specifically that sometimes reverse image searches do not always reveal any duplication of videos or photos so there's a need to carry on other forms of verification.

## Confirming sources of information

Identifying the original source is the goal that we want to reach when verifying digital content. As we mentioned above, one of the ways to do this is by using reverse image search as we saw above.

You can also use the same technique in TinEye, or Google image reverse to check out if the source of information is fake or not.

As an example: on Twitter there are many fake accounts, alled “bots”, that are created to spread information, or sometimes to spy on people through following them. Most bots, and other unreliable sources, will use stolen photographs of other people as their avatars. For example, the Twitter bot @LusDgrm166 seen highlighted in red in the image below: 

photo

A quick investigation of the account's avatar reveals that the Twitter account is not likely to be  operated by a human. All the accounts on the screenshot above are likely not operated by a human. They are tweeting about Syria with a hashtag #NaturalHealing and the content of their tweets is taken from Wikipedia, and other pages. 

After copying the URL of the avatar of @LusDgrm166  or downloading the avatar, paste the link/photo into a reverse Google image search to find similar pictures elsewhere online. As you can see in the image of the search results below, the image has been used by many twitter users as their profile image. 

Few questions to think about when checking a specific account to confirm if it's the original source:

- Has the account holder been reliable in the past?
- Where is the uploader based? 
- Are videos or photos descriptions consistent and mostly from a specific location? 
- Is their logo consistent across the videos?
- Does the uploader "scrape" videos/photos, or do they  upload solely user-generated content?
- How long have these accounts been active? How active are they?
- What information do affiliated accounts contain that indicate recent location, activity, reliability, bias or agenda of the account holder?

Once you have some answers of the questions above, such as: Name of the uploader from his or her YouTube channel, or linked websites to the uploader social media accounts, then you can use tools to get more information about the source. 

For example if you have the name or username of the person who uploaded the content online (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc) then you can run their name through a service called Webmii to find more information about them from websites, news outlets and social media accounts.


**Most importantly connect with the source directly to get information verified when possible, and make sure to ask "How do they know a specific info". They might be able to send you additional photos, and videos to help you verify a specific incidents. Make sure that you connect to sources securely so you don't put them at risk**. _Read about this more in chapter ......_

**Example:**

You found visual evidence on YouTube, but you don't know the uploader, you don't know if he's the original source, and you don't know if he's located in the area where the footage was taken.

photo

You can get more information about this source by running his name on Webmii as below:

photo

You will find most of the photos or videos that he uploaded online

photo


You will also find other digital content from different social media accounts that he shared online, or that others shared with him.

photo

This will give you a better understanding if this source is reliable or not, specially if you find information that answers the questions we have mentioned above to verify the source. 
In our example, the person works in a local media center in a city called Al-Safira. He has been doing this for years from the same location which gives him more credibility. 

You can use a different technique to check  the source in cases where you don't find the name of the person who uploaded the content online through social media platforms. The technique is  often usedwhen you are looking at verifying information that has been uploaded onto a website, rather than not social media platforms. 

**Example**:

If you are looking at a website that contains information that you would like to verify, but the website doesn't include the name of person who runs it, or if  you want to find more information about the person who runs the website such as their locationor phone number, then you can use a number of online services that could tell you this information. [whois service to find this info]. 


When you are registering your domain name with a domain provider they will usually ask you for a number of identifying details such as:

- Name of the person who registered the websites
- His/her address
- Phone number
- Email (The email below was obfuscated, but usually you can find clear email as username@domainname.com )

There are many websites online who offers a service to see all this registered data such as: https://who.is/ 
most of the domain registration websites offers this service as well.

Below are the results that you get by running whois on a website such as www.example.org. 

**Note:**: Some domain providers offer a service to hide this information from being public, and sometimes people obscure it on purpose for privacy reasons. 

photo

## Confirming the date of the event:

Verifying the date is one of the most important elements of verification, there are key questions which you need to consider when finding visual evidence online:
- When was the content created?
- When did the incident happen?

This is made easier when  people in the video mentioned the date of when the event happened, or show newspapers or write the date on a piece of paper to show it  to the camera such as the example below. 

photo

In the Syrian context most of the time, the original uploaders of the videos on YouTube will write the exact date of the incident with the video Title. In most cases this would be the correct date, specially if you are looking to a video from a vetted, verified source. 

This does not often happen in other contexts, and even in some events in Syria it was a challenge to verify the date easily without adding other ways to confirm it such as looking at the weather during the event, or connecting with the person who took the original footage so they can provide raw photo/video with metadata attached to it to ensure the date of the event.

**Example**:

Hundreds of videos were uploaded on YouTube by media activists in Syria during the Chemical attack which happened in Damascus on 21 August 21 2013. The uploaded videos were claimed to fabricated because the YouTube videos uploaded by activists were dated as 20/08/2013, while activists were saying that the attack happened in 21/08/2013. This happened because YouTube will date videos according to time-stamped in Pacific Standard Time (PST) rather than Eastern European Time (EET), as in this case, which  is why it's important to be aware of this. 

photo

Checking the weather (if possible) from a photo/video would be helpful to confirm the date of the event.

**Example:**

Below is a video which has been posted on “Al-Aan” TV channel claiming that clashes has been stopped in few areas in Syria because of the snow. 

photo

To verify this, enter the same date posted on YouTube to the website WolfaramAlpha, as shown below, to see if the weather was indeed snowy or not. 

photo

As you can see above, you can verify that the date posted on YouTube is likely to be correct based on the similar weather conditions. 

## Confirming the location:

The process of geolocating the visual evidence is essential to verifying whether the evidence you find is in the location it claims to be or not. Mapping platforms such as Open Street Map, Google Earth, Google Maps, Wikimapia and Paronamio will help you to locate those materials when possible. The key issue for geolocation is to collect as many images as possible to be able to use them all to verify as it will be harder to verify an incident from only one piece of footage.  

Below are few details to consider for confirming the location:

- License/number plates on vehicles
- Landmarks such as schools, hospitals, religious places, towers, etc
- Type of clothing
- Is there an identifiable shop or a building?
- What is the type of the terrain/environment in the shot?

**License/number plates on vehicles**

In this case, we wanted to identify the location of a suspected ISIS member. For many years she posted many pictures on social media account from Guyana, South America. To confirm that she is actually in Guyana, we looked at images where vehicle numbers are clearly visible. The white car in this picture holds the following number “BMM-5356”. 

photo

When searching this number through wikipedia, we found this below page that confirmed to us that those particular car plate numbers  belong to vehicle registration plates of Guyana.

photo

**Looking at Landmarks**

Looking at landmarks such as schools, hospitals, towers, religious buildings is very helpful when you are trying to geolocate visual evidence.  Mapping platform such as Wikimapia, Google Earth, Panoramio, and Google Maps are tagged with thousands of photos which could be used to geolocate your evidence. 

If you search for “schools” through Wikimapia, then all schools in the area would be shown to you as below.

photo

Panoramio works in a different way, where it will show you all photos in a specific area that are tagged to Google Maps. 

photo

Through both services you can find photos that will help you geolocate your evidence as the one below demonstrates. Below you can see a screenshot of Panoramio of a photoof a shop  found through the site. The photo includes the phone number of the shop, and a small board with full address on it. 

photo

Once you find the suspected location of your evidence, Google Earth can be very helpful to confirm if this is the actual location or not. Different techniques can be used for this which includes:

- Looking at structures
- Looking at terrain
- Using Google satellite image history

**Looking at structures**

You can see below an image of a mousque which has been captured by an activist who claims that this moqsue located in Jirs Al-shugur - Idlib. We located the mousque through google earth, and compared the structure between the sattelite image, and the image provided by the activist to make sure that it is actualy located in the claimed location. In this case we looked at the buildings' black windows, and how it's structured. 

photo

**Look at terrain**

Checking out the terrain of the claimed location through satellite imagery.

Below is one of thousands of photos leaked depicting violations of human rights in Syrian prisons. The leaked photo was geolocated through looking at the satellite image below, then the terrain which shows the hill that has the communication towers.  

Photo

**Using google history satellite image**

Below are images of Aleppo in 2010, and in 2013. You can see clearly the damaged areas. This can help you geolocate streets in this area even after being attacked as you can see the images before the damage/attack

photo

**Geolocating video through google satellite image**

Geolocating the filming location with Google earth. The below is an image from Jisr al-Shughur in Syria. In red the mosque minaret needed to be located. 

photo

As you can see from the above examples, technology has changed how we find and deal with sources and information. As witnesses, and activists share events in text, photos and videos on social media and blogs in real time. This can help human rights investogators verify events that are happening through visual evidence by using different technieques, and tools. Remember to read our chapter on how to use the verification tools as securely as possible before using it.

## How to carry out an online investigation as securely as possible

Using online serach tools, and investigation techniques can be very helpful to verify user generated digital content such as photos, and videos as we saw earlier in this chapter, but there are security issues related to this that you need to think about and consider before carrying on your online investigation. Some of these questions are:

1. How sensitive is the investigation you are carrying out? Are you going to be at risk if anyone knows that you are working on this investigation? Will other people involved in this investigation be at risk too?
2. How sensitive are the videos and photos you are dealing with and verifying? Would it put you at risk if someone saw that you have it? 
3. Do you know the security situation, and the privacy policy of the online services that you are using to upload your content for verification?
4. Do you connect securely to the internet while carrying on an online investigation so people connected to the same WiFi network don't see what you are looking at?
5. Do you hide your location while carrying out an online investigation so the sites you are visiting collect information that could identify you personaly later on?

These are some of the questions that you really need to think about, We will go through basic steps on how you carry on an online investigation as securely as possible. We will also go through the open source tools that you could use for investigation instead of the commercial software. By open source we mean tools that would let you review how it's built so you, or a technical expert that you know can understand if it's violating your security and privacy at any point. Commercial software won't let you do that so you won't be able to understand if it's respecting your privacy, or if it's allowing you to use it securely. 

**Basic steps for investigating online securely:**

**STEP 1:** Connecting securely to the internet:

Make sure that you are browsing sites securely, the ones you are investigating, or just revweing. You can do this by encrypting your communication with these sites when possible through SSL (Secure Socket Layer). 

_**Note: Some sites don't support secure communication, so people can see the websites you are visitng, and the information you are sending (log-in info, text, photo, video etc). This can be very risky if you are working in a public space using WiFi network.**_

**STEP 2:** Hiding your identity with Tor:


**STEP 3:** Use safer tools for verification, and investigation when possible:

**STEP 4:** Communicate securely with your sources of information so you don't put them or yourself at risk:


**STEP 5:** Make sure to back up relevant content you find, sites you visit, and conversations you have with sources of information:
- Archive.is
- Archive.org
